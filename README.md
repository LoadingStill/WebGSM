# Update 28 Dec 2024
I am still working on this project, but I am changing it A LOT.
I am working on learning docker and running this in docker containers instead of just nationally.
I was struggling a lot in making an API that would work properly from my lack of what I know and feature creep.


THIS IS AN ALPHA SOFTWARE!


Build the container:
`docker build -t webgsm .`

Run the Container:
`docker run -d -p 8082:8082 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock webgsm`

Access the Web App
Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:8082/frontend/index.html`

Notes:
The `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock` part allows the container to manage Docker on the host. This is powerful but riskyâ€”use with care.



Dockerfile  
/app  
are the new files and folder  

All the other files are the older versions. They will be put in the /app folder eventually
