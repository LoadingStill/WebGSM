# About LGSM-WebGUI

Welcome to LGSM-WebGUI, your gateway to a user-friendly graphical interface for LinuxGSM (Linux Game Server Managers). Our project is dedicated to simplifying server management for gamers, developers, and system administrators by providing an intuitive and powerful web-based GUI for LinuxGSM.

- Change the files permission to allow execution `sudo chmod +x ~/Downloads/LGSM-WebGui-Installer.sh`
- Run the file `sudo ~/Downloads/LGSM-WebGui-Installer.sh`

## Uninstalling
- Change the files permission to allow execution `sudo chmod +x /var/www/lgsm-webgui/uninstall.sh`
- Run the file `sudo rm /var/www/lgsm-webgui/uninstall.sh`
