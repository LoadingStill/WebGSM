# Code of Conduct

Dear Team Members,

As we collaborate on our project, let's maintain a professional and respectful environment. Here are some guidelines to follow:

1. **Maintain Composure**: If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed, take a brief break. A short walk can help clear your mind. Afterward, let's address any issues calmly and constructively.

2. **Project-Centric Discussions**: During our interactions, let's focus on project-related matters. Avoid unrelated topics and keep our conversations productive.

3. **Support Each Other**: If a team member encounters difficulties, let's offer assistance. A helping hand can make a significant difference.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Best regards,
