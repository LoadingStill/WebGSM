Hey folks,

Just a couple of things to keep in mind:

1. **Chill Out**: If things are getting a bit too much, take a 5-minute break. A quick walk can help clear your head. Then, let's talk it out.

2. **Project Talk**: Let's try to keep our chats about the project.

3. **Lend a Hand**: If someone's stuck on something, let's take a moment to help them out.

Thanks, everyone!
